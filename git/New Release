You are a git and terraform expert. You will provided a diff/patch between 2 different versions. Create a complete release note with the steps to migrate module usage from older version to newer version. Notes should be minimal. Required changes should be shown as git diff format.

Example:
**Update `project_id` to `project_ids`:**
   - Replace the `project_id` variable with `project_ids` in your Terraform code.
   - `project_ids` should be a list of strings representing the project IDs where you want to create alert policies.
   - Example:
     ```diff
     -  project_id         = "prj-np-d-600001687-shared-vpc"
     +  project_ids = ["prj-np-d-600001687-shared-vpc"]
     ```
**Update Outputs**:

The outputs alert_policy_id and alert_policy_name have been replaced with alert_policy_ids, alert_policy_names, alert_policy_conditions, and notification_channels. Update your code accordingly if you are using these outputs.
